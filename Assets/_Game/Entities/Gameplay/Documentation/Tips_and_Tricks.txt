# Tips and Tricks
Always work inside of the inner-most prefab. You can click on the arrow to the right of the object in the hierarchy to enter prefab mode.
If you do not, you must override changes on each nested prefab. This is a complex task, so please work only inside of the prefab itself.
## Prefab in Context
Working inside the prefab without being able to see any of the scene itself is not very convenient. You can enable a setting to view it in context of the rest of the scene (You can see everything else)
Select 'Edit > Project Settings' at the top of Unity.
Select 'Editor' on the left side.
Scroll down to 'Prefab Editing Envionrments'
Set 'Regular Environment' to the current scene you are working in.
Now the next time you open a prefab you should see the rest of the scene.
