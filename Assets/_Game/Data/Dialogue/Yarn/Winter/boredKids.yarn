title: boredKids

Nathan: So bored… Can we open presents now? 
Morgan: You know we’re not supposed to open presents until your dad gets home, Nathan. 
Nathan: But I’m so bored…
Morgan: Me too, but there’s not much we can do about that.
Nathan: [sprite="angry"] Ugh! 
: I should probably find the kids something to do before they both end up on the naughty list.
