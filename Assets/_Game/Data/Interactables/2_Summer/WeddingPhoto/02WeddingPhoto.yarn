narrator: You set the wedding photo on the top of the box where Jaqueline will find it. After a few minutes, she turns around and sees it.

Jaqueline: What is-? That wasn’t there before.

Jaqueline: [sprite="surprised"/] My wedding photo? Wait... did Dad have this in his room?

Jaqueline: ...

Jaqueline: I guess he did care a bit more than it seemed.

: Jaqueline brushes off the picture frame, then goes to set it up on the mantle of the fire place.
