Nathan: [sprite="angry"/] So bored… Can we open presents now? 

Morgan: You know we’re not supposed to open presents until your dad gets home, Nathan. 

Nathan: [sprite="angry"/] But I’m so bored…

Morgan: Me too, but there’s not much we can do about that.

Nathan: [sprite="angry"/] Ugh! 

Nolan: I should probably find the kids something to do before they both end up on the naughty list.
