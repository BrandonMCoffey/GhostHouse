Valerie: [sprite="surprise"/] Huh? 
Valerie: Hey Jaq? 
Jaqueline: Yeah? 
Valerie: Did you put Mom’s favorite ornament on the tree? 
Jaqueline: I, uh… I don’t know. Maybe? Why?
Valerie: Well it’s on the tree now and it wasn’t before. 
Jaqueline: Is it in the right spot?
Valerie: I think?
Valerie: … 
Valerie: Yup. On the highest bough.
