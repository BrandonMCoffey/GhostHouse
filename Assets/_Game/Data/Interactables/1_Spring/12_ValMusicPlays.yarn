Valerie: [sprite-"surprised"/] Did you do that? 

Jaqueline: [sprite-"surprised"/] No! Oh my god, it's your song Val! You and Morgan's really. It feels like yesterday you two were sitting at the piano together. 

Valerie: I'll go up and talk to her in a minute... I should apologize... After this song.
