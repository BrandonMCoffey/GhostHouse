Jaqueline: [sprite="surprised"/] Eep! Did you do that? Hey wait, I’ve heard this song before. Where’s it from? 

Valerie: [sprite="surprised"/] It was mom and dad’s song. 

Jaqueline: [sprite="surprised"/] Oh, yes! Remember when they used to slow dance to this song in the kitchen?

Valerie: [sprite="sad"/] I do... 

Valerie: [sprite="sad"/] You're right Jaqueline, I'll go up and talk to her in a minute... I should apologize... After this song.
