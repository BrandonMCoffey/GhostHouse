: The candles on Morgan’s altar are lit tonight and she seems to be fussing over it more than usual.

Morgan: [sprite="sad"/] I’m sorry I couldn’t make it more fancy, Grandpa, but Mom would kill me already if she saw all of this.

: Morgan looks back to check that the door is closed and locked before pulling a small rock with a chain out of her pocket.
