Nathan: [spirte="happy"/] Morgan! Morgan! 

Morgan: What?

Nathan: [spirte="happy"/] Can you play me a song on your trumpet?

Morgan: ...

Nathan: Please?

: There is a click as the door unlocks.

Morgan: [spirte="happy"/] Clarinet... but yeah sure.

: Nathan bounces happily into Morgan’s room, excited to spend time with his cousin. Music resonates softly from her room as she and Nathan spend time together.
