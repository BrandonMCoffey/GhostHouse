Name: You flip the light switch back on, turning on the front porch light. Pretty soon after, there is an increase in the amount of kids trick or treating at the door. Once there’s a pause, Jacqueline goes to Valerie’s room.

Name:Jaqueline [sprite=idle/] Hey, thanks for turning back on the front light. I didn’t realize it got turned off. Don’t worry about handing out candy to the kid though! I know you don’t like doing it and that you had a bad day at work.

Name:Valerie [sprite=happy/] Oh, um, thank you, Jaqueline? That’s sweet of you.
