Name: Rather than a letter, this seems to be a bill of some kind.

Name: Upon opening the bill, you realize its the final payment for the cost of a funeral that took place early this year.

Name: Poor kids, it seems they lost their grandfather Nolan shortly after Christmas. No wonder they were all so emotional this year.

Name: I’ll make sure this Christmas goes well for them.
